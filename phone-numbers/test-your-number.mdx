### ▶️ Place a Test Outbound Call

1. Open the **ConverseKit app** inside your Salesforce org.
2. Navigate to the **Phone Numbers** tab.
3. Locate your imported phone number and click **“Test Number”**.
4. Select any **Lead** or **Contact** from your org.
5. Click **“Place The Call”**.

> 🔊 The selected Lead/Contact will receive a phone call. If answered, they’ll hear and interact with your Voice Assistant in real time.

<Note>
  ⚠️ **Important: Mobile Number Format**

  ConverseKit uses the `Mobile Number` field from both `Lead` and `Contact `records when placing outbound calls.

  - Ensure the number is entered in **E.164 format** (e.g., `+1XXXXXXXXXX`).
  - Missing or incorrectly formatted numbers may result in failed calls.

  ✅ Example: `+14155552671` (U.S. number with country code)
</Note>

### 📲 Receive an Inbound Call

You can also test by simply calling the Twilio number from any phone:

1. Dial your imported **Twilio number** from any mobile or landline phone.
2. Your Assistant will answer and begin the conversation automatically.

> ✅ This confirms your setup is ready to handle live inbound conversations.
