Flow-based tools allow your **AI Voice Assistant** to execute powerful logic inside Salesforce — without writing code. You just build an **Autolaunched Flow**, and then connect it as a "Tool" in your ConverseKit app.

## 🛠️ Example Use Case: Create Case Tool

Let’s say you want your assistant to collect customer complaints and create a **Case record** in Salesforce.

#### ✅ Step 1: Go to Flow Builder

1. In Salesforce Setup, search for **“Flows”** in the Quick Find box.
2. Click **New Flow**
3. Choose **Autolaunched Flow (No Trigger)** → Click **Create**

---

#### 🧰 Step 2: Define Input Variables

Your assistant will pass data into this flow. You must **create variables** to accept that data.

For example, let’s collect:

- `name` (Text)
- `contact_number` (Number)
- `complaint` (Text)

For each:

1. Click the **Manager** tab (left sidebar)
2. Click **New Resource**
3. Choose **Variable**
4. Give it the exact API name (e.g., `name`, `contact_number`, `complaint`)
5. Set:
   - **Data Type** (e.g., Text or Number)
   - **Available for input** → ✅ Check this

Repeat for each parameter.

#### 📄 Step 3: Add the Logic (e.g., Create Case)

Now build the logic using Flow elements:

1. Click the **\+** icon and select **Create Records**
2. Label: `Create Case`
3. Create a new **Case** record
4. Set values like:
   - **Subject** → use `complaint`
   - **Contact Phone** → use `contact_number`
   - **Description** → use `complaint`
   - **Contact Name** → use `name`

💡 You can use any fields on the Case object based on your business logic.

---

#### 📤 Step 4: (Optional) Return Output to Assistant

If you want your flow to return a confirmation or message:

1. Create a new **Variable**
   - Name: `confirmation_message`
   - Data Type: **Text**
   - Check **Available for output**
2. Use an **Assignment** element to set the message:
   - `confirmation_message = "Case created successfully!"`

This will be returned to the assistant and spoken back to the user.

#### 💾 Step 5: Save & Activate

1. Click **Save**
   - Flow Label: `Create Voice Case`
   - API Name: `createvoicecase` (remember this for tool setup)
2. Click **Activate**
