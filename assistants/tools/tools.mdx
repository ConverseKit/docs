## 🔧 What Are Tools?

**Tools** in **ConverseKit** are like special abilities your voice assistant can use to _do_ something in Salesforce CRM. This means your assistant can do more than talk.

Imagine you’re a human rep talking to a customer. At some point, you might:

- Log a case
- Update opportunity's stage
- Check inventory
- Book a meeting

Your assistant can do the same—but only if it’s connected to backend logic. That logic is what **Tools** are for.

In technical terms:

- A **Tool** lets your assistant trigger a **Salesforce Flow** or **Apex REST method**
- It passes **input values** (like a name, phone number, or complaint)
- Your logic runs silently in the background
- Optionally, the tool can **pass the returned result** for the assistant to speak

So instead of just responding with scripted answers, your assistant can _actually take action_ in Salesforce.

## ⚙️ How Tools Work

Here’s a simple example:

> A caller says: “I want to report a complaint.”

Your assistant might reply:

> “Sure\! I’ll just need your name, number, and the issue.”

Then:

1. The assistant collects these details.
2. It calls the **Create_Case** tool.
3. The tool runs a **Flow** in Salesforce to create a Case record.
4. If successful, the assistant responds:

   > “Thanks\! I’ve created the case and our team will follow up shortly.”

💡 Just like a human support rep uses Salesforce while talking to customers, your assistant uses **Tools** to do the same—only automatically.

## 🧠 Why Use Tools?

Without tools, your assistant can only give pre-written responses.

With tools, your assistant becomes _interactive and smart_. It can:

- Look up data (e.g., “How many orders has John placed?”)
- Save customer requests (e.g., “Report my lost card.”)
- Run business logic (e.g., assign leads, calculate scores)
- Work with other apps via APIs (if you're using Apex)

This is where your assistant becomes **truly useful**.
