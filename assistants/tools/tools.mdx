## 🔧 What Are Tools?

In ConverseKit, Tools allow your voice assistants to perform real-time actions during a conversation, by invoking logic that runs directly within your Salesforce CRM. Whether it's updating a lead status, fetching records, or integrating with an external API, tools help your assistant do more than talk—they help it act.

When your assistant needs to take action—like booking an appointment, checking inventory, creating a case or assigning a follow-up—it calls the appropriate tool, passes input parameters (like a customer's name or date), and Once invoked, a tool silently performs backend logic and optionally returns a result for the assistant to use in its next spoken response.

ConverseKit supports two types of tools

1. **Salesforce Flows** — for point-and-click logic.
2. **Apex Rest Resource** — for advanced custom functionality.

While executing tools your assistant send a request to your flows or apex rest end point to process the data to bring the returned response into conversational context.

## 💡 Why Use Tools?

Without tools, your assistant is limited to static responses. With tools, it can:

- Fetch or update Salesforce data
- Trigger business logic workflows
- Make decisions based on real-time inputs
- Connect to external systems (via Apex)
- Personalize responses based on dynamic context

## 📝 Step-by-Step: Tool Creation

Here's what you'll need to fill in to create a tool like `Create_Case`.

---

<Note>
  **Pre-requisite**

  Before creating a tool, make sure you have an existing **Salesforce Flow** or **Apex REST method** that:

  - Accepts the required input parameters
  - Performs the necessary logic or actions (e.g., creating a case, fetching data)
  - Optionally returns a response back

  > ⚠️ **Don’t worry if you haven’t created one yet.** In the next sections, we’ll walk you through step-by-step examples of building both a Flow-based tool and an Apex-based tool.
  >
  > For now, you can proceed by assuming the backend logic already exists and continue with the tool setup steps.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Navigating to Tools">
    1. Open the **ConverseKit Salesforce App**.
    2. Navigate to the **Tools** tab.

      📌 Example: `Flow` (uses a flow named `createvoicecase`)
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Flow API Name / Apex REST Resource" required>
      Depending on the selected Action Type, enter:
