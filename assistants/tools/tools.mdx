## 🔧 What Are Tools?

In ConverseKit, Tools allow your voice assistants to perform real-time actions during a conversation, by invoking logic that runs directly within your Salesforce CRM. Whether it's updating a lead status, fetching records, or integrating with an external API, tools help your assistant do more than talk—they help it act.

When your assistant needs to take action—like booking an appointment, checking inventory, creating a case or assigning a follow-up—it calls the appropriate tool, passes input parameters (like a customer's name or date), and Once invoked, a tool silently performs backend logic and optionally returns a result for the assistant to use in its next spoken response.

ConverseKit supports two ways to create tools:

1. **Salesforce Flows** — for point-and-click logic.
2. **Apex Code** — for advanced custom functionality.

## 💡 Why Use Tools?

Without tools, your assistant is limited to static responses. With tools, it can:

- Fetch or update Salesforce data
- Trigger business logic workflows
- Make decisions based on real-time inputs
- Connect to external systems (via Apex)
- Personalize responses based on dynamic context

## 📝 Step-by-Step: Tool Creation

Here's what you'll need to fill in to create a tool like `Create_Case`.

<Note>
  **Pre-requisite**

  Before creating a tool, make sure you have an existing **Salesforce Flow** or **Apex REST method** that:

  - Accepts the required input parameters
  - Performs the necessary logic or actions (e.g., creating a case, fetching data)
  - Optionally returns a response back

  > ⚠️ **Don’t worry if you haven’t created one yet.** In the next sections, we’ll walk you through step-by-step examples of building both a Flow-based tool and an Apex-based tool.
  >
  > For now, you can proceed by assuming the backend logic already exists and continue with the tool setup steps.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Navigating to Tools">
    1. Open the **ConverseKit Salesforce App**.
    2. Navigate to the **Tools** tab.
    3. Click **“New Tool”**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Fill in the tool information using below sections">
    ### Tool Info

    <ParamField path="Tool Name" required>
      A unique name to identify the tool internally.\
      📌 Example: `Create_Case`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Description" required>
      Explain what the tool does.\
      📌 Example: _“This action is used to capture customer details (name, contact number, complaint) and store it into the system.”_
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Async">
      Specify whether the tool should run **asynchronously**, meaning the assistant can continue the conversation while the action runs in the background.

      ✅ Set to `true` if you don't want the assistant to wait.
    </ParamField>
    ### Server Details

    <ParamField path="Tool Type" required>
      Select the type of backend logic this tool invokes:

      - **Flow** – For low-code automation using Salesforce Flows.
      - **Apex REST Resource** – For custom business logic using Apex classes.

      📌 Example: `Flow` (uses a flow named `createvoicecase`)
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Flow API Name / Apex REST Resource" required>
      Depending on the selected Action Type, enter:

      - The **API Name** of the Salesforce Flow or The **URL Mapping** attribute of your Apex REST resource class

      📌 Example: `createvoicecase`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Timeout (Seconds)" required>
      How long to wait for a response before timing out.\
      📌 Example: `20`
    </ParamField>
    ## Tool Parameters

    List the inputs your tool needs from the assistant. Each parameter includes:

    <ParamField path="parameter" required>
      The field name (e.g., `phone`)
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Parameter Type" required>
      Data type (e.g., `string`, `number`)
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="Desciption" required>
      Brief description of what it captures

      <ParamField path="required" type="check box">
        whether this parameter is mandatory?
      </ParamField>
      📌 Example Parameters:

      - `name` (string, required): Name of the customer
      - `contact_number` (number, required): Contact number
      - `complaint` (string, required): Complaint description
    </ParamField>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 💬 System Messages

These messages are optional but recommended for good conversational UX. They inform the user of what’s happening in the background.

| Message Type          | Description                                               |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Request Start**     | Assistant begins processing the request                   |
| **Request Delayed**   | If processing takes longer than expected                  |
| **Request Completed** | Tool executed successfully                                |
| **Request Failed**    | Something went wrong (fallback message shown to the user) |

📌 Example:

> _“Your details are captured successfully, I will be notifying our team to reach out to you.”_

## ✅ Final Step: Save and Link to Assistant

Once the tool is saved:

- Go to your **Assistant's configuration page**
- Navigate to the **Tools** section
- Click **Add Tool**
- Choose your newly created tool and map the assistant’s extracted data fields to the tool’s parameters

Now your assistant can trigger this action during a live conversation\!
