Before deploying your Voice Assistant, test how it speaks, responds, and handles real-world scenarios—right from Salesforce.

### 🎙️ Talk to Your Assistant

1. Open the **ConverseKit App** in Salesforce.
2. Go to the **Assistants** tab.
3. Click into the Assistant you want to test.
4. Scroll down to the **Test Assistant** section.
5. Click **“Talk with Assistant”**.
6. When prompted, **allow microphone access** in your browser.

Your assistant will begin the conversation using your configured prompts. You can simulate full user flows and observe how it behaves live.
