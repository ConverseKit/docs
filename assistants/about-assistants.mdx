## What are ConverseKit Assistants?

ConverseKit Assistants are **Generative Voice Agents** designed to **enhance** **and** **automate** **customer interactions**, providing personalized and efficient communication 24/7. These intelligent agents engage with your customers, help achieve your business goals, and streamline operations—all without the need for human intervention.

## Key Features of ConverseKit Assistants:

1. More than just Conversations

   **Tools** in ConverseKit let your AI Voice Agents do more than just talk. It can take real actions inside Salesforce—like getting lead information, updating a record, or starting a workflow—**all during a live conversation**. This helps make the conversation smarter, faster, and more useful for both the caller and your team.

   **Example**: A customer calls to check the status of their lead, and the assistant handles the entire process—right from understanding the request to fetching the data and responding:

   > “Hi, this is Ava from ConverseKit\! I see you’re calling about your application—let me quickly pull up your record… Yes, your lead status is currently _Under Review_. Would you like me to update your contact details while you're here?”
2. **Intelligent Functionality**\
   Imagine having an assistant that can answer customer questions, book appointments, or gather information during a phone call—all without a human operator.

   **Example**: A customer calls to book an appointment, and the assistant handles the entire process, from greeting to scheduling:

   > “Hi, I’m Sarah from XYZ Clinic\! Would you like to schedule an appointment today?”
3. **Customer Engagement**

   Our Voice Assistants aren’t just passive—they actively engage your customers. ConverseKit can **initiate conversations**, **answer questions**, and **provide information**, just like a real agent.

   **Example**: A customer calls in to inquire about available products. The assistant answers:

   > “We have the latest model of our SmartWatch. It has 5-day battery life, fitness tracking, and water resistance. Would you like to know more?”
4. **Knowledge Base**

   **Knowledge Base** lets you train your AI Voice Agent to speak your business language. You can feed it all your company’s information—like FAQs, product details, services, policies, and more—so it understands your business just like YOU do. This means it can give **accurate, helpful answers** specific to your company, 24/7.

   **Example**: A customer calls to ask about your return policy, and the agent instantly responds with the exact answer based on your internal data:

   > “Hi\! I’m Mia from ShopSmart. You can return any product within 30 days of purchase, as long as it’s unused and in original packaging. Would you like me to start a return request for you now?”
5. **Intelligent Lead Distribution**

   **Distribution Rules** help you decide **which AI Voice Agent should handle which call**. You can set up rules based on your business needs—like region, language, type of lead, or purpose (sales, support, follow-up, etc.).

   It also lets you **run targeted campaigns** by assigning specific leads to the right agents. Once assigned, those leads are **automatically added to the agent’s call queue**, ready to be contacted.

   This means you can train and deploy **different agents for different jobs**, and the system will smartly send the right call to the right agent—**no manual effort needed.**
6. **Scalable Outreach**

   ConverseKit Assistants can handle **hundreds or thousands** of interactions simultaneously, whether you're calling customers for an offer or conducting a survey.

   **Example**: You want to remind customers about their upcoming dentist appointment. The assistant automatically calls each customer to confirm:

   > “Hi, this is your reminder from Dr. Lee’s Dental Clinic. You’re scheduled for an appointment tomorrow at 10 AM. See you then\!”
7. **Cost-Effective Solutions**

   Voice Agents reduce the need for large call centers, saving your business significant money while maintaining excellent customer service.

   **Example**: Instead of paying for a live agent to answer every customer inquiry, ConverseKit Assistants handle routine questions about office hours, availability, and service details automatically.
8. **Future-Ready Technology**

   Adopt AI-powered Voice Agents to stay competitive. ConverseKit allows your business to harness the power of cutting-edge technology without complexity.

   **Example**: By adopting ConverseKit's Generative Voice Agents, you ensure that your business can handle customer queries efficiently 24/7, staying ahead of competitors still relying on manual agents.

With ConverseKit's versatile agents, you can seamlessly manage both outbound and inbound calls, integrating them into your Salesforce ecosystem to improve customer interactions and optimize workflows. Here's how our agents can be used in both types of scenarios:

## Outbound Calls

Outbound agents are like your team’s helpers who make the first move by calling potential customers or following up with existing ones. They’re great for things like reaching out to new leads, reminding customers about appointments, or checking in after a purchase.

Here are some simple examples of how you can use outbound agents in your business:

1. **Lead Generation:**
   - **Scenario:** Your team at **TechNova Solutions** is running a marketing campaign to introduce a new software product. The outbound ConverseKit agent calls potential leads based on a pre-defined list from Salesforce.
   - **Example:**

     > "Hello, this is Sarah from **TechNova Solutions**. We recently launched **InnovaCloud**, our latest cloud software, and thought it could be a great fit for your business. I'd love to schedule a time to chat more about how it can help you streamline your operations. Can I find a time that works for you?"
   - After the call, the agent logs the conversation and lead status in Salesforce, so your sales team can easily follow up.
2. **Appointment Reminders:**
   - **Scenario:** **CleanCo Services**, a cleaning service company, uses outbound agents to remind clients of upcoming service appointments.
   - **Example:**

     > "Hi, [Customer Name], this is Tom from **CleanCo Services**. Just a friendly reminder about your scheduled cleaning appointment tomorrow at 10:00 AM. We look forward to seeing you\! Please reply if you need to reschedule."
   - The agent updates Salesforce with a “reminder sent” note, and any rescheduling details are logged for follow-up.
3. **Customer Feedback After Purchase:**
   - **Scenario:** After a customer purchases a smart thermostat from **GreenTech Home Solutions**, an outbound agent follows up to gather feedback.
   - **Example:**

     > "Hi [Customer Name], I’m calling from **GreenTech Home Solutions** to check how your recent order of the **EcoSmart Thermostat** is working out for you. Do you have a moment to share your thoughts with us?"
   - The feedback is captured in Salesforce, linked to the specific customer’s order history, and flagged for your customer success team to review.

## Inbound Calls

Inbound agents are there to answer calls when your customers reach out to you. They help answer questions, solve problems, or give updates, making sure your customers get the help they need right away.

Here are some simple examples of how you can use outbound agents in your business:

1. **Customer Support and Troubleshooting:**
   - **Scenario:** A customer calls into **FreshBites Catering** with a question about their recent event order. The inbound ConverseKit agent helps resolve the issue.
   - **Example:**

     > "Hello, thank you for calling **FreshBites Catering** Support. I see you recently placed an order for a corporate event. What seems to be the problem today?"
   - The issue is logged in Salesforce, and the customer’s order details and past interactions are immediately available to the agent for a smooth and efficient resolution.
2. **Order Tracking and Updates:**
   - **Scenario:** A customer from **SportsGear Pro** calls to inquire about the status of their order for new running shoes. The inbound agent pulls up the order details from Salesforce and provides real-time updates.
   - **Example:**

     > "Hi Sam, let me check your order for you. It looks like your order #12345 is out for delivery and should arrive by Thursday."
   - The agent updates Salesforce with the latest order tracking information and logs the call details for future reference.
3. **Call Routing:**
   - **Scenario:** A customer calls into **UrbanGlow Spa** with a general inquiry. The inbound ConverseKit agent routes the call to the appropriate department (e.g., bookings, billing, or services).
   - **Example:**

     > "Hi, thanks for calling **UrbanGlow Spa**. I see you're asking about our massage services. Let me connect you to our bookings team to help you schedule an appointment."
   - The routing data is logged in Salesforce, including the call transfer details, so you can track where the customer was directed and the outcome.
