## What are ConverseKit Assistants?

ConverseKit Assistants are **Generative Voice Agents** designed to **enhance** **and** **automate** **customer interactions**, providing personalized and efficient communication 24/7. These intelligent agents engage with your customers, help achieve your business goals, and streamline operations—all without the need for human intervention.

## Key Features of ConverseKit Assistants:

1. **More than just Conversations**

   Tools in ConverseKit let your AI Voice Agents do more than just talk. It can take real actions inside Salesforce—like getting lead information, updating a record, or starting a workflow—**all during a live conversation**. This helps make the conversation smarter, faster, and more useful for both the caller and your team.

   **Example**: A customer calls to check the status of their lead, and the assistant handles the entire process—right from understanding the request to fetching the data and responding:

   > “Hi, this is Ava from ConverseKit\! I see you’re calling about your application—let me quickly pull up your record… Yes, your lead status is currently _Under Review_. Would you like me to update your contact details while you're here?”
2. **Intelligent Functionality**\
   Imagine having an assistant that can answer customer questions, book appointments, or gather information during a phone call—all without a human operator.

   **Example**: A customer calls to book an appointment, and the assistant handles the entire process, from greeting to scheduling:

   > “Hi, I’m Sarah from XYZ Clinic\! Would you like to schedule an appointment today?”
3. **Customer Engagement**

   Our voice assistants aren’t just passive—they actively engage your customers. ConverseKit can **initiate conversations**, **answer questions**, and **provide information**, just like a real agent.

   **Example**: A customer calls in to inquire about available products. The assistant answers:

   > “We have the latest model of our SmartWatch. It has 5-day battery life, fitness tracking, and water resistance. Would you like to know more?”
4. **Knowledge Base**

   **Knowledge Base** lets you train your AI Voice Agent to speak your business language. You can feed it all your company’s information—like FAQs, product details, services, policies, and more—so it understands your business just like YOU do. This means it can give **accurate, helpful answers** specific to your company, 24/7.

   **Example**: A customer calls to ask about your return policy, and the agent instantly responds with the exact answer based on your internal data:

   > “Hi\! I’m Mia from ShopSmart. You can return any product within 30 days of purchase, as long as it’s unused and in original packaging. Would you like me to start a return request for you now?”
5. **Scalable Outreach**

   ConverseKit Assistants can handle **hundreds or thousands** of interactions simultaneously, whether you're calling customers for an offer or conducting a survey.

   **Example**: You want to remind customers about their upcoming dentist appointment. The assistant automatically calls each customer to confirm:

   > “Hi, this is your reminder from Dr. Lee’s Dental Clinic. You’re scheduled for an appointment tomorrow at 10 AM. See you then\!”
6. **Cost-Effective Solutions**

   Voice Agents reduce the need for large call centers, saving your business significant money while maintaining excellent customer service.

   **Example**: Instead of paying for a live agent to answer every customer inquiry, ConverseKit Assistants handle routine questions about office hours, availability, and service details automatically.
7. **Future-Ready Technology**

   Adopt AI-powered voice assistants to stay competitive. ConverseKit allows your business to harness the power of cutting-edge technology without complexity.
